Sukhman's First Simple Hangman 🎩💀

Think You Can Guess the Word?

Welcome to Sukhman's First Simple Hangman, a classic word-guessing game where you either guess the word correctly or face the wrath of the hangman! This version of Hangman is designed to be simple, fun, and addictive—perfect for those who want a quick challenge.

🕹️ How to Play

The game selects a random word.

You have a limited number of guesses before the hangman is complete.

Guess one letter at a time.

If the letter is in the word, it gets revealed.

If the letter isn't in the word, you get closer to defeat.

Win by guessing the full word before running out of chances!

Can you outsmart the hangman, or will you face the inevitable? 👀
